# HELLO,

I'm **Thomas** from **Herbert Engineering**. I worked as an innovation engineer for over seven years, focusing on hardware-related software development.

I'm currently starting a new chapter in my life by becoming a freelancer. I'm offering any kind of software development for microcontrollers.

Please let me know if you need help with your software development. I would be happy to assist you.

Best regards

Thomas
